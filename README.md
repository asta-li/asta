# Hi, I'm Asta.

This is my personal website.

## Development

1. **Clone the repo.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asta-li/asta.git
```

2. **Develop locally.**

Start the website locally.
```sh
cd asta
gatsby develop
```
View the website at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Deploy.**

Create production build and deploy to Github Pages.
This pushes the built code to the `deploy` branch.
```sh
npm run deploy
```

## Thanks
