Hi, I'm Asta!

I'm building [Privy](http://privy.io/). We build simple, powerful APIs to help web3 devs manage private, end-to-end encrypted user data.

I used to build data infra and ML models for self-driving cars at [Aurora](https://aurora.tech/), where I joined as one of the first engineers.


### Some cool stuff
- We [raised an $8.3M Seed](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/20/blueyard-sequoia-invest-in-privy-to-bring-secure-data-to-web-3/) from Sequoia and Blueyard.
- Privy [came out of stealth](https://blog.privy.io/introducing-privy-8bc6edab736)!
- I gave a talk at ETH Denver 2022: "[Boom and Bust in Self-Driving and Web3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAwdOS0kbUA)"
- I was one of BusinessInsider's [rising stars of autonomous driving](https://www.businessinsider.com/introducing-the-rising-stars-of-autonomous-driving-2019-12) in 2019
- I gave a talk at Amazonâ€™s Re:MARS conference: "[The Future of Self-Driving Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBw7b4SUlto)"
